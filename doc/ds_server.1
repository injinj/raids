ds_server \- Rai distribution server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
ds_server [\f[I]options\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The ds_server command attaches to shared memory segments created by
kv_server in order to serve key values to remote clients using Redis,
Memcached, and/or HTTP protocols.
.PP
Multiple ds_server processes may run at the same time using different
ports or the same ports, as long as the \-P option is used for setting
the SO_REUSEPORT socket property.
This option is not enabled by default because it also prevents multiple
instances from running and binding to the same port, in the case that is
desired.
.PP
Each instance attaached to the same shared memory is aware of any other
instance no matter which ports are being served.
This is necessary because of the blocking Redis commands and the PubSub
notifications.
These will cross process boundaries through posix shared memory pipes
located in /dev/shm.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-m map
The name of map file.
A prefix file, sysv, posix indicates the type of shared memory.
The sysv prefix below is the default.
The file prefix uses open(2) and mmap(2).
The posix prefix uses shm_open(2) and mmap(2).
The sysv prefix uses shmget(2) and shmat(2).
All of these try to use 1GB huge page size first, then 2MB huge page
size, then the default page size.

.RE
.TP
.B \-p redis\-port
The TCP port to listen for Redis clients, default is 6379.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-d memcached\-port
The TCP port to listen for Memcached clients, default is 11211.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-u memcached\-udp\-port
The UDP port to listen for Memcached UDP clients, default is 11211.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-w http\-port
The TCP port to listen for HTTP / Websock clients, default is 48080.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-D db\-num
The default database number to use for keys, can be between 0 and 254.
Each database does not see the other databases keys, but the PubSub
operations are global (they are stored in database 255).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-x maximum\-fd
The epoll(7) set is created with this number of fd slots, There is 1 fd
used for epoll, 2 fds used for signals and timers, and 1 fd each for the
listeners of the network protocols enabled.
The ulimit for the process may need to be increased to allow the system
to use them.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-k keepalive\-timeout
The keepalive set on the TCP sockets.
This causes TCP pings every timeout / 3 and if 3 timeouts are missed,
then the socket is closed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-f [0|1]
Prefetch keys when there are multiple in flight.
Usually this is a win, but can lose if the hot keys fit within the
system caches, where prefetching doesn't help.
The default is true (1).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-P
Allow multiple processes to bind to the same port.
The Linux kernel will load balance the connections to each of the
processes bound to the same port.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-4
Use only IPv4 addresses.
If not specified, then both IPv4 and IPv6 can be used.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-s
Don't use SIGUSR1 notification.
To notify other processes that a message is available, the other process
is signaled.
Without a signal, the process needs to busy poll (eats CPU) or timed
poll (increases latency).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-b
Busy poll, never sleep always running.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-X
Do not listen to the default ports, only listen on ports which are
specified.
